	<h1>Visual Design Artifacts</h1>	
<br>
	<h2>Artifact #1:</h2>`
	<img src="Artifacts/Album.png" width="142" height="121" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>
	<p>I did this because Ariana Grande is a great singer and has a great voice. I chose the "Just keep Breathing" part of her song and a graceful tone and picture of her. That helps to bring out the nice sweet tone of the album cover.</p>
</br>
	
<br>
<h2>Artifact #2:</h2>
<img src="Artifacts/Pepsi Logo Recreation.png" width="142" height="134" alt=""/>
	<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
	<p>This was to show how I could draw the pespi logo from my core memory. I drew it wrong, but I did the best I could. </p>
	</br>

<br>
<h2>Artifact #3:</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts/Pizza.png" width="140" height="130" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
	<p>The three toppings I chose were pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. I sliced it up into 8 peices. I would honestly eat this but like, I'm not really sure. </p>
</br>

<br>
<h2>Artifact #4:</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts/Shoe.png" width="138" height="90" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
	<p>I based this shows off addidas. I feel I did really good on these shoes. It wasn't complete, but from the sketch it looks really good.</p>
</br>

<br>
<h2>Artifact #5:</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts/Street Block.png" width="155" height="125" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
	<p>I made this project by using the grid, using the shape tool, and using color fill and gradient. I included a supermarket, a stop sign, and apartments. I also added windows, doors, a sky, a road, clouds, and a sidewalk. The most challenging part of this project was trying to make the shading/lighting between the left and right sides. The easiest part was making the buildings and details (sky, ground, stop sign, windows ect.).</p>
</br>

<br>
<h2>Artifact #6:</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts/Weird Character.png" width="128" height="141" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
	<p>I chose the fruit strawberry. It has 4 facial features, a pair of shoes, a hat, and arms. It also has a purse. I liked how this turned out because it looks a little realistic to me.</p>
